This PyQt5-based app acts as a calculator for four different geometric shapes. 
Upon launching, users encounter a list of shapes and must choose one. After selection, 
the app guides users to the relevant calculator page, facilitating input of parameters to compute
the area of the chosen shape. Each shape's calculator page features a home button for convenient 
navigation back to the main page.
The rules outlined in the <new.py> file specify the necessary parameters for calculation. 
Additionally, if certain parameters are set to 0, the app displays error or warning messages in red
to alert the user.
